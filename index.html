    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> June 4, 2025</p>

    <p>SoulSignal AI ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application ("the app").</p>

    <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or share any personal data or health information from users. All AI analysis and symptom interpretation are performed locally on your device. We do not require login, registration, or any form of user identity.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since the app processes data entirely offline, there is no transmission of your information over the internet. This greatly reduces the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.</p>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>SoulSignal AI does not integrate any third-party services, advertising SDKs, or analytics tools that collect user data. Your experience is fully private and ad-free.</p>

    <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app does not target or provide services to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal data from children.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Consent</h2>
    <p>By using the app, you agree to this privacy policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the application.</p>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Any significant changes will be published on this page. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.</p>

    <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, feel free to contact us:</p>
